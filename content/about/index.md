## Hi, I'm Oskar ðŸ‘‹

Since 2016, I have been running a small, family-owned trading business in the stainless steel equipment sector for the food industry. In my free time, I also build [indie projects](/projects). I've never had an opportunity to learn good programming, so I take advantage of no-code and low-code tools that are available on the market. I use them every day, both in my company and in developing side-hustle businesses. I like to automate things and always try to make processes in my life better and more optimized.

I enjoy learning new skills. Last year, I managed to become (almost) fluent in German - you can read about this experience [here](/12-months-to-learn-german).

From time to time, I send a newsletter to my small group of subscribers - you're very welcome to join (subscription form at the bottom of the page).
